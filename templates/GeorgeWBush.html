  <h2>George W. Bush</h2>
  <div class="paragraph">
      George W. Bush was president from January 20, 2001 to January 20, 2009. The son of former president George H. W. Bush,
      he eked out a controversial victory in the 2000 election against his Democratic opponent, then vice president Al Gore.
      Very early in his term, the course of global geopolitics was dramatically reshaped by the 9/11 attacks on America,
      which would lead Bush and allied countries to wage a global War on Terror to stamp out Al-Qaeda, the organization
      behind 9/11, and its allies. Among Bush's targets in this war was Iraq, which he made the decision to invade in
      2003, based on the faulty premise that Saddam Hussein was linked with Al-Qaeda and was hiding weapons of mass
      destruction. After winning reelection in 2004, Bush's approval ratings would steadily but dramatically decline,
      with the president being dogged by the federal government's poor response to Hurricane Katrina, continuing controversy
      over the Iraq War, and the subprime mortgage crisis, which would eventually snowball into the worst financial crisis
      since the Great Depression. Bush left office with some of the lowest approval ratings ever for a president, and
      amidst the Democrats having recaptured control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.
