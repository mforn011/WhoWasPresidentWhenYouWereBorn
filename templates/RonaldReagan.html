  <h2>Ronald Reagan</h2>
  <div class="paragraph">
      Ronald Reagan was president from January 20, 1981 to January 20, 1989. He won resoundingly in 1980 and 1984,
      defeating Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale in landslides. To deal with stagflation and recession, Reagan proposed
      and enacted a series of tax cuts and deregulation, as well as increased interest rates. At the same time, Reagan
      ended d√©tente with the Soviet Union and ramped up the arms race through increased defense spending. His presidency
      saw dramatically reduced inflation and unemployment, and renewed confidence in America. Many academics also credit
      Reagan for contributing to the end of the Cold War through his aggressive foreign policy.
