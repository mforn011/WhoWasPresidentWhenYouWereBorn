  <h2>Barack Obama</h2>
  <div class="paragraph">
      Barack Obama was president from January 20, 2009 to January 20, 2017. The first African-American president in US
      history, Obama was confronted with the worst economic climate since the Great Depression soon after taking office.
      To prevent further worsening of conditions, Obama lobbied for the passage of a large stimulus bill, and signed it
      into law after it was passed. He also bailed out American automakers on the verge of bankruptcy, and enacted major
      financial regulations to prevent another similar crisis from occurring. The biggest achievement of his first term
      was the Affordable Care Act, which enacted significant changes to the American healthcare system. Despite a poor
      showing by his party in the 2010 midterms, Obama managed to win reelection in 2012. His second term would see the
      eventual recovery of the US economy, with unemployment at the end of his term the lowest since 2007. His presidency
      would also see the legalization of same-sex marriage, via the Supreme Court decision <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>.
